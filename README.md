Institutions: IsraelXTelAvivUniversity

Subject: Computer Science

Level: Intermediate

Subjects:

->Information Security basic terminology, vulnerabilities, exploits, and an in-depth look at a real case-study (namely, Meltdown).

->An overview of cryptography with an emphasis on symmetric ciphers.

->A high-level examination of hash functions and an overview of common hash algorithms.

->A critical look at different authentication schemes, including passwords, challenge-response, and biometrics.

->An overview of the most critical vulnerability of all times - buffer overflow, including common variants like Variable and Stack Overflow and simple yet effective mitigation techniques like canaries and DEP

->An introduction to the typical Internet protocol stack vulnerabilities, including IP Spoofing, TCP Injections, and DDoS, and useful defenses against them like NAT Boxes and Firewalls

->An in-depth look at the cryptographic concepts and techniques that make up the security infrastructure of the Internet: Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, RSA Public-Key Cryptography, Digital Signatures and MAC

->A survey of the world wide web's security concerns (SQL Injections, CSRF, and XSS): is the Internet ultimately vulnerable or is there a silver lining?

->An introduction to the world of malware: viruses, worms, Trojans and more - computer viruses and how to beat them
