#hw1-crack safe with 4 digits
The function check_password(password) is used by a safe with 4-digits passwords, and is susceptible to timing attacks. More specifically, it takes it around 0.1 seconds to check one digit – so brute-forcing all the possible combinations will take more than an hour. Can you implement a way to crack its password in less than a minute?

solution takes 8 sec - simple python code


#hw2- Implement Caesar’s cipher: implement a function encrypt that given a plaintext string and a key  k  (how many letters to shift), returns a ciphertext where each character is shifted  k  places.
You can assume all characters are lowercase letters, with no punctuation or spaces backward
(so with  k=2  'c' is encrypted by 'a')
