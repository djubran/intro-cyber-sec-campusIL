"""
In the following hackxercise, use scapy to read the pcap file, which is a recording of some network traffic captured with a sniffer (namely, Wireshark), and figure out what is the username and the password.

Submit your answers in the following text boxes. 

This hackxercise cannot be implemented on your local Python environment because the pcap file is only available inside the Codeboard system.

The traffic happens over port 8000, which scapy doesn't interpret as HTTP by default (because HTTP's default port is 80). To have it associate HTTP with port 8000, run:
bind_layers(TCP, HTTP, dport=8000)
bind_layers(TCP, HTTP, sport=8000)

There are actually two login attempts â€” the first one fails with "invalid credentials", and only the second one is successful.
